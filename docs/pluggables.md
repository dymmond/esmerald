# Pluggables

What are pluggables in an Esmerald context? A separate and individual piece of software that
can be hooked into **any** Esmerald application and perform specific actions individually without
breaking the ecosystem.

A feature that got a lof of inspirations from the great frameworks out there but simplified for
the Esmerald ecosystem.

Take Django as example. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of plugins for Django and usually,
not always, the way of using them is by adding that same pluggin into the `INSTALLED_APPS` and
go from there.

Flask on the other hand has a pattern of having those plugin objects with an `init_app` function.

Well, what if we could have the best of both? [Esmerald](./application/applications.md) as you
are aware is extremely flexible and dynamic in design and therefore having an `INSTALLED_APPS`
wouldn't make too much sense right?

Also, how could we create this pattern, like Flask, to have an `init_app` and allow the application
to do the rest for you? Well, Esmerald now does that via its internal protocols and interfaces.

In Esmerald world, this is called [**pluggable**](#pluggable).

!!! Note
    Pluggables only exist on an [application level](./application/levels.md#application-levels).

## Pluggable

This object is one of a kind and does **a lot of magic** for you when creating a pluggble for
your application or even for distribution.

A **pluggable** is an object that receives an [Extension](#extension) class with parameters
and hooks them into your Esmerald application and executes the [extend](#extend) method when
starting the system.

```python hl_lines="27 29"
{!> ../docs_src/pluggables/pluggable.py !}
```

It is this simple but is it the only way to add a pluggable into the system? **Short answser is no**.

More details about this in [hooking a pluggable into the application](#hooking-pluggables).

!!! Danger
    If another object but the [Extension](#extension) is provided to the Pluggable, it will
    raise an `ImproperlyConfigured`. Pluggables are **always expecting an Extension to be provided**.

## Extension

This is the main class that should be extended when creating a pluggable for Esmerald.

This object internally uses the protocols to make sure you follow the patterns needed to hook
a pluggable via `pluggables` parameter when instantiating an esmerald application.

When subclassing this object **you must implement** the [extend](#extend) function. This function is what
Esmerald looks for when looking up for pluggables for your application and executes the logic.

Think of the `extend` as the `init_app` of Flask but enforced as a pattern for Esmerald.

```python hl_lines="7 13"
{!> ../docs_src/pluggables/extension.py !}
```

### extend()

The **mandatory** function that **must be implemented** when creating an extension to be plugged
via [Pluggable](#pluggable) into Esmerald.

It is the entry-point for your extension.

The extend by default expects `kwargs` to be provided but you can pass your own default parameters
as well as there are many ways of creating and [hooking a pluggable]

## Hooking pluggables

As mentioned before, there are different ways of hooking a pluggable into your Esmerald application.

### The automated and default way

When using the default and automated way, Esmerald expects the pluggable to be passed into a dict
`pluggables` upon instantiation of an Esmerald application with `key-pair` value entries and where
the `key` is the name for your pluggable and the `value` is an instance [Pluggable](#pluggable)
holding your [Extension](#extension) object.

When added in this way, Esmerald internally **hooks** your pluggable into the application and
starts it by calling the [extend](#extend) with the provided parameters, automatically.

The `app` parameter is automatically injected by Esmerald and does not need to be passed as
parameter if needed

```python hl_lines="27 29"
{!> ../docs_src/pluggables/pluggable.py !}
```

You can access all the pluggables of your application via `app.pluggables` at any given time.

### The manual and independent way

Sometimes you simply don't want to start the pluggable inside an Esmerald instance automatically
and you simply want to start by yourself and on your own, very much in the way Flask does with
the `init_app`.

This way you don't need to use the [Pluggable](#pluggable) object in any way and instead you can
simply just use the [Extension](#extension) class or even your own since you **are in control**
of the extension.

```python hl_lines="25 42-43"
{!> ../docs_src/pluggables/manual.py !}
```

### Standalone object

But, what if I don't want to use the [Extension](#extension) object for my pluggable? Is this
possible?

Short answer, yes, but this comes with limitations:

* You **cannot** hook the class within a [Pluggable](#pluggable) and use the automated way.
* You **will always need** to start it manually.

```python hl_lines="9 25 42-43"
{!> ../docs_src/pluggables/standalone.py !}
```

## Important notes

As you can see, **pluggables** in Esmerald can be a powerful tool that isolates common
functionality from the main Esmerald application and can be used to leverage the creation of plugins
to be used across your applications and/or to create opensource packages for any need.

## ChildEsmerald and pluggables

A [Pluggable](#pluggable) **is not the same** as a [ChildEsmerald](./routing/router.md#child-esmerald-application).

These are two completely independent pieces of functionality with completely different purposes, be
careful when considering one and the other.

Can a [ChildEsmerald](./routing/router.md#child-esmerald-application) be added as a pluggable?
Of course.

You can do whatever you want with a pluggable, that is the beauty of this system.

Let us see how it would look like if you had a pluggable where the goal was to add a **ChildEsmerald**
into the current applications being plugged.

```python hl_lines="33"
{!> ../docs_src/pluggables/child_esmerald.py !}
```

Crazy dynamic, isn't it? So clean and so simple that you can do whatever you desire with Esmerald.

## Pluggables and the application settings

Like almost everything in Esmerald, you can also add the [Pluggables](#pluggable) via
[settings](./application/settings.md) instead of adding when you instantiate the application.

```python hl_lines="29-31"
{!> ../docs_src/pluggables/settings.py !}
```

And simply start the application.

```shell
ESMERALD_SETTINGS_MODULE=AppSettings uvicorn src:app --reload

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [28720]
INFO:     Started server process [28722]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

If you prefer, you can also use the [settings_module](./application/settings.md#the-settings_module).

```python hl_lines="34"
{!> ../docs_src/pluggables/settings_module.py !}
```
