# Examples & Scaffolds

Starting a project can be a bit tricky mostly because some decisions need to be made regarding maintenance and
structure of a project. Usually is something like:

1. How should you structure the folders.
2. Where should I place X files.
3. Where should the settings be.

And some others.

**Bear in mind this is simply one example how to structure and does not constitute any opinionated option.**
**You are free to ignore this section and do it in your own way**.

## Esmerald scaffold

To help you out with some of those decisions, we developed a [scaffold](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald-scaffold)
with some examples how to jump start a project quickly without wasting a lot of time and presenting one folder option
for the project.

### What does it bring

* `deployment` folder - Where some deployment files are placed. This is based on a previous doc about
[docker](./deployment/docker.md). Feel free to ignore.
* `README.md` - Auto generated readme file with instructions how to run.
* `Makefile` - Classic UNIX like Makefile with some pre-defined commands used within the scaffold.
* The project itself - The source code for the scaffold.
    * `apps` - Where the scaffold apps live.
    * `core` - Containing core common files, such as settings.
    * `tests` - Some already made tests for the scaffold views.
    * `main` - Containing the application logic to start.
    * `serve` - A personal touch. Based on Django `manage.py`, we thought it would be nice to have a similar file
that helps you out with the startup of a project. **Should only be used for development purposes**.
    * `urls` - Containing urls of the application.

!!! Note
    The auto-generated `README.md` of the scaffold contains some instructions how to run it quick and simple using
    the `Makefile` commands.

### How to use it

To use the [scaffold](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald-scaffold) you will need to have installed:

* python 3.8+
* [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

And to install, run:

```shell
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald-scaffold
```

And simply follow the instructions.

Once the project is generated you should have a folder structure similar to this:

```shell
.
├── Dockerfile # similar Dockerfile.conf from the docker examples
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── deployment
│   ├── nginx.conf # similar nginx.conf from the docker examples
│   └── supervisor.conf # similar supervisor.conf from the docker examples
├── requirements.txt
└── src # or the name given by you when generating the project
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── apps
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── welcome
    │       ├── __init__.py
    │       └── v1
    │           ├── __init__.py
    │           ├── urls.py
    │           └── controllers.py
    ├── core
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   └── __init__.cpython-39.pyc
    │   └── configs
    │       ├── __init__.py
    │       ├── development
    │       │   ├── __init__.py
    │       │   └── settings.py
    │       └── testing
    │           ├── __init__.py
    │           └── settings.py
    ├── main.py
    ├── serve.py
    ├── tests
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── test_app.py
    └── urls.py
```

### The welcome app

The way the [scaffold](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald-scaffold) was designed was not to replace any possible
design, instead, it was conceived with the idea of facilitating your life when starting a project.

The `welcome` app located inside `/apps/` contains two examples of views. One as function based view and another
using classes and [permissions](./permissions.md).

The tests are running against those views so if you delete them, the tests are expected to fail.

### The URLs

The `urls` were structured to show you how powerful the [Include](./routing/routes.md#include) is and how clean
an instance of Esmerald can be when starting a project containing a log of urls as you can see from the `main.py`.

### Settings

The [settings](./application/settings.md) where placed inside a `config` folder and separated by enviroment also to
show you what Esmerald means by **Simplicity from settings**.

### Makefile

Contains all available commands that can be used within the [scaffold](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald-scaffold)
and if you want to list them all simply run:

```shell
$ make # Lists all available commands
```

The `Makefile` contains two very important commands. The `make run` and the `make test`.

As you can probably notice, the `make run` runs with the `DevelopmentSettings` module and the `make test` with
`TestingSettings` module.

**Both development and testing settings are passed via ESMERALD_SETTINGS_MODULE**.

We hope this scaffold can help you clearing out some ideas or even giving you new ones for your applications.

## Nginx, Gunicorn, Tortoise and Docker

We all know how hard it can be to think about deployments and configurations to go live and for that reason there is
also a cookiecutter available based on the [esmerald scaffold](#esmerald-scaffold) with a lot of extra files
prepared for the deployment (if needed) and adds an extra flavour in case you want to also use Tortoise ORM.

This can be done for any ORM, really. The goal of the cookiecutter is to give a complex, production ready and similar
approach to the normal go-lives.

### How to use

To use the [scaffold](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald-tortoise-nginx-gunicorn-supervisor) you will need to have installed:

* python 3.8+
* [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

And to install, run:

```shell
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald-tortoise-nginx-gunicorn-supervisor
```

And simply follow the instructions.

### What does it bring inside

As mentioned before, this is very similar to the [esmerald scaffold](#esmerald-scaffold) so you can expect
a similar folder structure as that one but also adds some extras.

* `deployment` - Folder containing nginx, supervisor and gunicorn configurations.
* `docker` - Folder containing a Dockerfile ready to be used and deployed.

The URLs, tests and Makefile file also follows the same structure as the [esmerald scaffold](#how-to-use).

For a more comprehensive explanation, simply install the cookiecutter and give it a try.
