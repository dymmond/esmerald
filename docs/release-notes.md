# Release Notes

## 2.0.5

### Changed

- Updated the way `esmerald` client operates internally.
- Updated internal minimum requirements.

### Fix

- Regression in OpenAPI when adding middleware to `Gateway` or `HTTPHandler`. When a middleware
was added, the OpenAPI would not generate the docs for it. The API would still work but not OpenAPI
docs.

## 2.0.4

### Changed

- Updated functional internal crypto to only use the system random.
- Cleaner codebase for the application settings.
- Updated version of Asyncz to be at least 0.5.0.

### Added

- Custom exception handlers, `from esmerald.exception_handlers import value_error_handler`.
- New native exception handler for pydantic v2 Validation errors in general.
- Dataclasses (normal and Pydantic dataclases) are now supported as Esmerald Responses.
- Support for [OpenAPI Webhooks](./routing/webhooks.md).
- Improved [Responses](./responses.md) documentation with examples using Pydantic BaseModel and dataclasses.
- OpenAPI Spotlight Elements documentation. When starting the application, accesing the default `/docs/elements`.
- Support for [Edgy](https://edgy.tarsild.io) ORM. [Docs here](https://esmerald.dev/databases/edgy/motivation/).

### Fixed

- Removed old pydantic v1 syntax from tests and applications.
- `add_include()` that wasn't generating signature models upon import.
- OpenAPI query params with defaults weren't loading properly.

## 2.0.3

!!! Note
    This addition was supposed to go in the release [2.0.2](#202) but somehow it was missed in the merge of
    the pull requests. It is not a bug fix but instead is a simple new
    [directive](./directives/shell.md) that can be useful for those who like using the command-line.

    It is important to understand that this support **won't be available on releases** of Esmerald
    1.X.

### Added

- [Interactive shell](./directives/shell.md) support directive for any Esmerald application.

## 2.0.2

### Changed

- Updated Field, Form and Body from `esmerald.params` with current defaults.
- Removed redundant cast from `File` to `Body` as it is a subclass.

### Added

- Added `strict` and `max_digits` esmerald params `esmerald.params`.
- Deprecate `example` as OpenAPI 3.10 supports `examples`. Use examples instead of `example`.

### Fixed

- [UploadFile](./extras/upload-files.md) sending as a list and as normal.
This got broken when the migration to pydantic 2.0 happened.
- `File` and `Form` from `esmerald.params` now accept `annotation`.
- OpenAPI for `UploadFile` as single and list now being parsed as a model.


## 2.0.1

This is a small fix into the parser of lists for the OpenAPI specification.

### Fixed

- [OpenAPIResponse](https://esmerald.dev/responses#openapi-responses) now allows proper parse of
lists as definition. [More details](https://esmerald.dev/responses/#lists).

## 2.0.0

!!! Warning
	When upgrading Esmerald to version 2, this also means the use of Pydantic 2.0 at its core as well as corresponsing technologies
	already updated to version 2 of Pydantic (Saffier, Asyncz...).
	If you still wish to continue to use Pydantic 1 with Esmerald, it is recommended to use Esmerald prior to version 2.0 which it will
	be maintained for a shor period but we **strongly recommend to always use the latest version**.

### Changed

- **Major update of the core of Esmerald from Pydantic v1 to Pydantic v2.**
- `ResponseSpecification` renamed to `OpenAPIResponse`, `from esmerald.openapi.datastructures import OpenAPIResponse`.
- Changed deprecated functions such as `validator` and `root_validator` to `field_validator` and `model_validator`.
- Transformers no longer support custom fields. Pydantic natively handles that.
- EsmeraldSignature updated for the new version of the FieldInfo.
- `params` reflect the new Pydantic FieldInfo.
- Deprecated OpenAPIView in favour of the new OpenAPI documentation generator.
- Changed OpenAPI config to reflect the new generation of OpenAPI documentation.
- Internal data field is now returning Body type parameter making it easier to integrate with Pydantic 2.0.
- General codebase cleanup.
- Removed old OpenAPI document generator in favour to the newest, fastest, simplest and more effective approach in v2.
- Remove the support of pydantic 1.0. Esmerald 2+ will only support pydantic 2+.

### Added

- OpenAPI support for OAuth2.

### Fixed

- FileResponse `stat_result` and Stream `iterator` typing.
- Fix typing across the whole codebase.
- Transformers are now generating Param fields directly.
- Updated __fields__ in favour of the new pydantic model_fields approach.

## 1.3.0

### Changed

- OpenAPI imports and removed unused dependencies.
- Deprecate `pydantic_factories` in favour of `pyfactories`.
- Dropped support for Tortoise ORM natively.

### Fixed

- Rename `scripts/format` to `scripts/lint` for consistency.
- `get_hasher` from contrib fixed with the return value of the algorithm.
- Typing of the codebase updated.

## 1.2.5

### Fixed

- Fixed show_urls for openapi specification.

## 1.2.4

### Changed

- Exception handler logic refactored.

## 1.2.3

### Fixed

- Upgrade Starlette version to >=0.27.0 for a security release. Details on [Starlette's security](https://github.com/encode/starlette/security/advisories/GHSA-v5gw-mw7f-84px)

## 1.2.2

- Removed old core management in favour of click.
- Deprecated `management` package in favour of `directives`. [#83](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/83).
- Deprecate `esmerald-admin`. Now you can simply call `esmerald` with the same directives
as before. Simplification via command line [#86](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/86).
	- Example:
		- `esmerald createproject <NAME>`
		- `esmerald createpapp <NAME>`

### Added

- Support for Ruff.
- New esmerald core admin management directives [#83](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/83).
- New directives client.

- Updated Github CI to deploy also to https://esmerald.dev [#73](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/73)

### Added

- Internal implementation of on_startup and on_shutdown. [#74](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/74).
- Added new internal implementation of on_event and add_event_handler functions. [#74](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/74).

### Fixed

- New Starlette Lifespan [#75](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/75). This is now also available to be done in the same way Starlette does. Internally Esmerald also implements the on_startup and on_shutdown but that is an unique implementation. This implementation follows the same pattern as the official [Starlette Bridge](https://starlette-bridge.tarsild.io/)

## 1.0.0

### Changed

- ChildEsmerald now supports the parent which means it can share middlewares and interceptors
across main application and children.

    !!! Note
        Prior to version 1.0.0, sharing resources between Esmerald and ChildEsmerald was not allowed
        and it needed to be treated as completely isolated application. In the version 1.0.0 you can
        still isolate them but you can also share resources.


## 0.15.0

### Added

-  Esmerald [Pluggables](./pluggables.md) [#60](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/60).

	This is the feature for the esmerald ecosystem that allows you to create plugins and extensions for any application
	as well as distribute them as installable packages.

- New [add_child_esmerald](./routing/router.md#add_child_esmerald) allowing adding via function, ChildEsmerald [#61](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/61).

	Add child esmeralds via functions once the application is created and dynamically.

### Added

- Brand new support for [Saffier](https://saffier.tarsild.io). A brand new ORM running
on the top of SQLAlchemy in an async fashion.

- New docs regarding the [Saffier](https://esmerald.dev/databases/saffier/motivation/) integration.
Those include also an example how to use it.

### Changed

evolving at a normal pace and blocking security patches from being properly applied.

### Fixed

- Old package versioning conflicts.

## 0.13.0

- Changed the imports for `UJSON` to `from esmerald.datastructures.encoders import UJSON` [#45](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/45).
- Moved the scheduler to optional installation with `pip install esmerald[schedulers]` [#45](https://github.com/dymmond/esmerald/pull/45).

#### Backwards compatibility
This is only applied for those who have esmerald prior to `0.11.0`.
If you already had template configurations, jwt, schedulers or all the features you need to update the imports to:

    ```

- **JWTConfig**:
    ```python
    from esmerald.config.jwt import JWTConfig
    ```

    ```python
    from asyncz.schedulers import AsyncIOScheduler # for the Scheduler class
    from asyncz.contrib.esmerald.decorator import scheduler # for the decorator
    ```
