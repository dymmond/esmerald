# Deployment

There are many ways of running deployments and deploying
an Esmerald application is the same as deploying any other ASGI application as
it requires analysis, strategies and design choices tailored to your needs.

Esmerald provides some insights and ideas how to perform those but these, like everything, are not
required from you to follow. Esmerald simply helps you understand some ideas of how you could do it.
