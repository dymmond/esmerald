# Architecture Patterns

When building scalable and maintainable Esmerald applications, it's essential to choose the right architecture pattern. This guide explores common architecture styles and how to implement them using Esmerald.

---

## Project Structure

Keeping your project organized is crucial. A common structure for medium to large Esmerald applications looks like this:

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ v1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ endpoints/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ security.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”œâ”€â”€ schemas/
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
```

## Pattern 1: Monolithic

All code is packaged into a single deployable unit.

**Pros**:
- Simple to develop and deploy
- Great for small projects

**Cons**:
- Hard to scale and maintain as the app grows

**Example**:
```python
from esmerald import Esmerald, get

@get("/")
def home() -> dict:
    return {"message": "Welcome to the monolith"}

app = Esmerald(routes=[home])
```

---

## Pattern 2: Modular / Feature-Based

Break your application into features or domains.

**Structure**:
```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ schemas.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ items/
...
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier to maintain
- Encourages separation of concerns

**Example**:
```python
# features/users/routes.py
from esmerald import get

@get("/users")
def list_users() -> dict:
    return ["Alice", "Bob"]

# main.py
from esmerald import Esmerald
from features.users.routes import list_users

app = Esmerald(routes=[list_users])
```

---

## Pattern 3: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Structure your application around domain concepts.

**Folders**:
- `domain/` (core business logic)
- `application/` (use cases)
- `infrastructure/` (DB, APIs)
- `interfaces/` (HTTP, CLI)

**Benefits**:
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to reason about business rules

---

## Pattern 4: Microservices

Split functionality into separate deployable services.

**Esmerald's support**:
- Lightweight
- Decoupled services via HTTP or gRPC
- Dynamic routing with versioning

**Example**:
- Service A: `/users`
- Service B: `/payments`

Deploy independently and communicate via HTTP or messaging queues.

## Choosing the Right Pattern

| Project Type        | Suggested Pattern       |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Small Script/API    | Monolith                 |
| Medium App          | Modular / Feature-Based  |
| Large App/Enterprise| DDD or Microservices     |
