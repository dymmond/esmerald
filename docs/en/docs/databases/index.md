# Database Integrations

Esmerald out of the box supports [Edgy](https://edgy.dymmond.com) and [Mongoz](https://mongoz.dymmond.com).

Explore the documentation for more details how to use them.

You don't need to use these directly, you can integrate with any database at your choice. Esmerald is agnostic to
any database.
