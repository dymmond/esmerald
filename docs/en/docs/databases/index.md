# Database Integrations

Ravyn out of the box supports [Edgy](https://edgy.dymmond.com) and [Mongoz](https://mongoz.dymmond.com).

Explore the documentation for more details how to use them.

You don't need to use these directly, you can integrate with any database at your choice. Ravyn is agnostic to
any database.
