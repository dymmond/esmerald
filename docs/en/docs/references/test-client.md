# Test Client

Ravyn offers an extension of the Lilya `TestClient` called `EsmeraldTestClient` as well
as a `create_client` that can be used for context testing.

```python
from ravyn.testclient import EsmeraldTestClient
```

::: ravyn.testclient.EsmeraldTestClient

```python
from ravyn.testclient import create_client
```

You can [learn more](https://ravyn.dev/testclient/#context-manager-create_client) how to
use it in the documentation.
