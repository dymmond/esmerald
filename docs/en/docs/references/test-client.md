# Test Client

Esmerald offers an extension of the Lilya `TestClient` called `EsmeraldTestClient` as well
as a `create_client` that can be used for context testing.


```python
from esmerald.testclient import EsmeraldTestClient
```

::: esmerald.testclient.EsmeraldTestClient


```python
from esmerald.testclient import create_client
```
