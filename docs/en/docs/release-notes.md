# Release Notes

Why is this happening? Is Esmerald going away? **No, absolutely not. Esmerald remains and will remain as is and will keep growing**
as it has its own use cases.

The reason for the rebranding its because the ecosystem has grown a lot and Esmerald was the first tool being created.
Since then it was released as version 3+.

This happened because of internal dependencies, and we already removed all of them but goes a bit off compared to the rest
of the ecosystem.

This is the reason for Ravyn to come into existence and to keep everything aligned with the future projects coming out.

## 0.1.0

We are proud to announce the **first official release of Ravyn (0.1.0)** —
the async web framework that builds on the strengths of **Ravyn** while embracing a new identity and future roadmap.

## Highlights

- **New Identity:** Esmerald has been forked to **Ravyn**. All imports, documentation, and branding now reflect this change.

## Migration from Esmerald

This is not mandatory **at all** but if you want to start using Ravyn right away, you can simply do:

- Replace all `esmerald` imports with `ravyn`.
- No breaking changes in core APIs — projects built on Ravyn should run with minimal adjustments.

Again, **Ravyn** is a fork of Esmerald with the same concepts, same everything.
