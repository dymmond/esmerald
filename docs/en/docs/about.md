# About

Ravyn was born in 2022 from the idea of two developers creating something
unique and easy for any person to install and use.

It was never designed to "compete" or "steal market" from anyone. In fact,
those two developers designed Ravyn to be a complement to the current Python ecosystem.

## Inspiration

At the very beginning of the documentation it is mentioned some great frameworks that inspired
Ravyn but we believe that the one that paved the way for all the great tech out there was undoubtedly, Django.

## What is coming in the future

As Ravyn comtinues to steadily grow and wih the help of the community, the future looks very bright
and for sure new features can and will be added according to the needs of the ecosystem.
