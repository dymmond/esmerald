# TemplateConfig

TemplateConfig is a simple set of configurations that when passed enables the template engine.

!!! info
    Currently Esmerald supports `Jinja2`.

It is important to understand that you don't need to use the provided `JinjaTemplateEngine`
from Esmerald within the `TemplateConfig`.

You are free to build your own and pass it to the `TemplateConfig`. This way you can design however you see fit.

!!! Tip
    Esmerald being built on top of Lilya, uses the `JinjaTemplateEngine` from it which means you can read
    the [Jinja2Template](https://www.lilya.dev/templates/#jinja2template) from Lilya to understand
    the parameters and how to use them.

    You can also create your own jinja2 engine and pass it in the `engine` parameter of the `TemplateConfig`.

    You will notice the name of the parameters in the `TemplateConfig` match maority of the jinja2 implementation.

## TemplateConfig and application

To use the TemplateConfig in an application instance.

```python hl_lines="4-5 9"
{!> ../../../docs_src/configurations/template/example1.py!}
```

## Parameters

All the parameters and defaults are available in the [TemplateConfig Reference](../references/configurations/template.md).

## TemplateConfig and application settings

The TemplateConfig can be done directly via [application instantiation](#templateconfig-and-application)
but also via settings.

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/configurations/template/settings.py!}
```

This will make sure you keep the settings clean, separated and without a bloated **Esmerald** instance.

## `url_for`

Esmerald automatically provides the `url_for` when using the jinja template system, that means
you can do something like this:

```jinja
{!> ../../../docs_src/_shared/jinja.html!}
```

## How to use

Simply return `Template` (of esmerald) not `TemplateResponse` with a `name` parameter pointing to the relative path of the template.
You can pass extra data via setting the `context` parameter to a dictionary containing the extra data.

To select the return type (txt, html) you need to name the files: `foo.html.jinja`.

## Using async templates

A very good feature of jinja2 is that you can you can have async templates. This means awaitables are automatically resolved
and async iteration is supported out of the box.
This is especially useful for the async ORMs, for example [Edgy](https://edgy.dymmond.com).

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/configurations/template/settings_async.py!}
```

And now you can iterate over QuerySets out of the box. Nothing else is required.

Note that internally the template response switches the render method and uses the async content feature of lilya
so you can only access the body attribute after calling `__call__` or `resolve_async_content()`.
