## 🔥 Sponsor the author

The author built this framework with all of his heart and dedication and will continue to do it so but that also
requires time and resources and when they are limited, the process still gets there but takes a bit longer.

You can financially help and support the author though [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tarsil)

He can afterwards go for a coffee☕, on him, to say thanks🙏.

You can become a [**Special One**](https://github.com/sponsors/tarsil/sponsorships?sponsor=tarsil&tier_id=230059&preview=false)
or a [**Legend**](https://github.com/sponsors/tarsil/sponsorships?sponsor=tarsil&tier_id=230042&preview=false)
sponsor for Ravyn.

## ⚙️ Sponsor the tools that made Ravyn possible

As you have seen in the documentation, Ravyn stands on the shoulders of giants, Starlette (initially) and Pydantic.
Although Ravyn is not longer on top of Starlette, for a very long time it was and they deserve all the help
they can get.

You can also sponsor:

* <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/samuelcolvin" class="external-link" target="_blank">Samuel Colvin (Pydantic)</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/encode" class="external-link" target="_blank">Encode (Starlette, Uvicorn)</a>
