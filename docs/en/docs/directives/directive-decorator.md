# The `@directive` decorator

Having [built-in directives](./directives.md) from Ravyn is great as it gives you a lot of
niceties for your project but having **custom directives** is what really powers up your
application and takes it to another level.

But what if you want to use a modern client to declare directives?

Ravyn uses [Sayer](https://sayer.dymmond.com) under the hood and now this allows to bring the
`@directive` decorator to make your life easier.

{!> ../../../docs_src/_shared/autodiscovery.md !}

!!! Tip
    As for Ravyn 3.8.3+, both [custom directives](./custom-directives.md) and `@directive`
    are supported.

## The `@directive`

This is still a custom directive but using **Sayer** under the hood to run your directives.

On the contrary of [class based directives](./custom-directives.md), the syntax when using the `@directive`
is simpler when calling.

```python
esmerald run <custom-directive> <ARGS>
```

Quite simple, right?

### Importing the decorator

This is even simpler:

```python
from ravyn.core.directives.decorator import directive
```

Or

```python
from ravyn import directive
```

!!! Danger
    The `@decorator` **must always be on top of the `@command` **but not the other way around.

    **Ok**

    ```python
    from esmerald import decorator
    from sayer import command

    @directive
    @command
    async def create(...): ...
    ```

    **Not ok**

    ```python
    from esmerald import decorator
    from sayer import command

    @command
    @directive
    async def create(...): .
    ```

### Where should directives be placed at?

All the custom directives created **must be** inside a `directives/operations` package in order to
be discovered.

The place for the `directives/operations` can be anywhere in your application and
you can have **more than one** as well.

Example:

```shell hl_lines="10 16 22 36"
.
├── Taskfile.yaml
└── myproject
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── apps
    │   ├── accounts
    │   │   ├── directives
    │   │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   │   └── operations
    │   │   │       ├── createsuperuser.py
    │   │   │       └── __init__.py
    │   ├── payroll
    │   │   ├── directives
    │   │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   │   └── operations
    │   │   │       ├── run_payroll.py
    │   │   │       └── __init__.py
    │   ├── products
    │   │   ├── directives
    │   │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   │   └── operations
    │   │   │       ├── createproduct.py
    │   │   │       └── __init__.py
    ├── configs
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── development
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   └── settings.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   └── testing
    │       ├── __init__.py
    │       └── settings.py
    ├── directives
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── operations
    │       ├── db_shell.py
    │       └── __init__.py
    ├── main.py
    ├── serve.py
    ├── tests
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── test_app.py
    └── urls.py
```

As you can see from the previous example, we have four directives:

* **createsuperuser** - Inside `accounts/directives/operations`.
* **run_payroll** - Inside `payroll/directives/operations`.
* **createproduct** - Inside `products/directives/operations`.
* **db_shell** - Inside `./directives/operations`.

All of them, no matter where you put the directive, are inside a **directives/operations** where
esmerald always looks at.

**This is the same as usual in Ravyn, nothing has changed**.

## Help

There are two helps in place for the directives. The one you run the esmerald executor (run) and the
one for the `directive`.

### --help

This command **is only used for the executor help**, for example:

```shell
$ ravyn run --help
```

### -h/--h

This flag is used to access the `directive` help and not the `run`.

```shell
$ ravyn run mydirective -h
```

Or

```shell
$ ravyn run mydirective --h
```

### Notes

The **only way to see the help of a directive** is via `-h`/`--h`.

If `--help` is used, it will only show the help of the `run` and not the `directive` itself.

## Order of priority

**This is very important to understand**.

What happens if we have two custom directives with the same
name?

Let us use the following structure as example:

```shell hl_lines="10 32"
.
├── Taskfile.yaml
└── myproject
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── apps
    │   ├── accounts
    │   │   ├── directives
    │   │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   │   └── operations
    │   │   │       ├── createsuperuser.py
    │   │   │       └── __init__.py
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   ├── models.py
    │   │   ├── tests.py
    │   │   └── v1
    │   │       ├── __init__.py
    │   │       ├── schemas.py
    │   │       ├── urls.py
    │   │       └── controllers.py
    ├── configs
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── development
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   └── settings.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   └── testing
    │       ├── __init__.py
    │       └── settings.py
    ├── directives
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── operations
    │       ├── createsuperuser.py
    │       └── __init__.py
    ├── main.py
    ├── serve.py
    ├── tests
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── test_app.py
    └── urls.py
```

This example is simulating a structure of a esmerald project with
**two custom directives with the same name**.

The first directive is inside `./directives/operations/` and the second inside
`./apps/accounts/directives/operations`.

Ravyn directives work on a **First Found First Executed** principle and that means if you have
two custom directives with the same name, esmerald will
**execute the first found directive with that given name**.

In other words, if you want to execute the `createsuperuser` from the `accounts`, the first found
directive inside `./directives/operations/` **shall have a different name** or else it will execute
it instead of the intended from `accounts`.

## Execution

Ravyn directives use the same events as the one passed in the application.

For example, if you want to execute database operations and the database connections should be
established before hand, you can do in two ways:

* Use [Lifespan](../lifespan-events.md) events and the directives will use them.
* Establish the connections (open and close) inside the Directive directly.

The [pratical example](#a-practical-example) uses the [lifespan events](../lifespan-events.md) to
execute the operations. This way you only need one place to manage the needed application events.

## Example

Lets transform the example from [createsuperuser](./custom-directives.md#the-createsuperuser) into a `@directive` form.

As you could see from the explanation, its the same as the normal [class based directives](./custom-directives.md).

### The `createsuperuser` custom directive

Let's do the `createsuperuser` now using the `@directive`.

```python title="myproject/directives/operations/createsuperuser.py"
{!> ../../../docs_src/directives/example/createsuperuser_decorator.py !}
```

And this should be it. We now have a `createsuperuser` and an application and now we can run
in the command line:

**Using the --app or ESMERALD_DEFAULT_APP**

```shell
$ ravyn --app myproject.main:app run createsuperuser --first-name Ravyn --last-name Framework --email example@ravyn.dev --username ravyn --password ravyn
```

Or

```shell
$ export ESMERALD_DEFAULT_APP=myproject.main:app
$ ravyn run createsuperuser --first-name Ravyn --last-name Framework --email example@ravyn.dev --username ravyn --password ravyn
```

As you can see, the `@directive` acts as the class based directives but in a different syntax.

## The `display_in_cli` option

You probably read everything about directives in Ravyn by now and that is awesome.

Now there is one last thing that would be good for you to know, the `display_in_cli`

!!! Warning "Pay Attention!"
    This only works with `@directive` decorator and nothing else.

Wouldn't you like to have the option when you create a directive, instead of doing:

```shell
ravyn run <DIRECTIVE>
```

You could do directly:

```shell
ravyn <DIRECTIVE
```

This is nice, isn't it? Well, now it is possible thanks to the `display_in_cli` parameter
of the `@directive` decorator.

This also means that your directives are now automatically recognised by Ravyn and display as
one of the available **Ravyn** commands.

Let us redo the `createsuperuser` to use this method.

```python title="myproject/directives/operations/createsuperuser.py"
{!> ../../../docs_src/directives/example/createsuperuser_decorator_in_cli.py !}
```

As you can see, the `@directive(display_in_cli=True)` is now present. You can now do

```
esmerald --help
```

And your directive should display as if it was a native command of Ravyn. Amazing!

Since this is a [Sayer](https://sayer.dymmond.com) `@command`, this means the way of calling
your directive is via `create-user`.

```shell
ravyn create-user --first-name Ravyn --last-name Framework --email example@ravyn.dev --username ravyn --password ravyn
```

You can also do now `--help` on the command.

```
esmerald create-user --help
```

As per normal Ravyn directives.
