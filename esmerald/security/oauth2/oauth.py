class OAuth2PasswordRequestForm(BaseModel):

    This is a dependency class to collect the `username` and `password` as form data
    for an OAuth2 password flow.

    The OAuth2 specification dictates that for a password flow the data should be
    collected using form data (instead of JSON) and that it should have the specific
    fields `username` and `password`.

    All the initialization parameters are extracted from the request.

    Read more about it in the
    [Esmerald docs for Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer](https://esmerald.dev/tutorial/security/simple-oauth2/).

    from typing import Annotated

    from esmerald import Esmerald, Gateway, Inject, Injects, post
    from esmerald.security.oauth2 import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm

    Note that for OAuth2 the scope `items:read` is a single scope in an opaque string.
    You could have custom internal logic to separate it by colon characters (`:`) or
    similar, and get the two parts `items` and `read`. Many applications do that to
    group and organize permissions, you could do it as well in your application, just
    know that that it is application specific, it's not part of the specification.
